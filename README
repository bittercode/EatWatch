This is my work on replicating my old EatWatch app for palm.

The idea, the math behind it and the larger framework for losing weight all come from "The Hacker's Diet" by John Walker. There are a number of other tools that already exist to go with the book and I recommend checking out the site as a place to begin. https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/
